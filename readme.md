Handlebars

Approach taken:
First I wireframed and created a mockup in HTML.
Then I started writing my server-side code and created 
a Handlebars template.
I am sending the values from the input boxes to the 
server via AJAX POST request.
I am using the GET request to fill out the template.
I am deleting data from the db via POST request.

Unsolved problems:
I am still unable to Update data, and I have a bug where rows in the 
table are being duplicated. As a workaround, I have the page
refresh and append instead of simply appending, which 
somehow works. I can't find where to fix the bug.
